My findings
-----------
-----------

 tes.html
----------
 1.Avoid using inline css codes (<FONT FACE="verdana" COLOR="green">) which is shown in the code.SEO wise it could an issue.
 
 2.<DIV ID="fb-root"></DIV> is been put outside the body tags. its not a good practice i belive.

 3.Needless useage of <SCRIPT></SCRIPT> in second last line.

 4.Avoid scripting directly in the page . jquery ajax function is bee initialised in page directly itself.which could be again seo issue.instead try scripting functions in external page include it.


getinfo.php
-----------
  1.Well i guess instead using require_once we can go with inlcude or inlcude_once. so that execution of the scriot doesnt stops if any warnings or minor error is there.

  2.Unknown class name 'dataObj' has been called which is not declaration anywhere.
  
  3.Error: additional ')' in $ArrayURL = split('/', $_SERVER[REQUEST_URI]));

  4.Instead of split you coould use explode ehich my consume less time.split is mainly used for regular expression split.

data.php
---------

1.functions get and getAll in class baseObj does not contains $table parameter and its been used in query.
